title: More Spiritual Than Jesus
---

> Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.” And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;  nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”  
> —**Matthew 26:38-39**

A friend reminded me yesterday of this great truth: "**Don't be more spiritual than Jesus**."

We need to be careful to not try to be more spiritual than Jesus. He didn't just willfully walk up and with open and happy arms embrace the suffering that He saw on the horizon. He wrestled with God in agony over what He was about to do. He fell to the ground crying out, sorrowful “to death.” This is far different than being giddy about His calling to go the Cross and die. Jesus was real with the Father in His time of great need. He connected with the Father intimately and left His burden with Him.

Why do we feel like we need to be the "hero" of our own life and have everything together all the time? Many times, we are afraid to be messy and to let others see us messy because we want to portray and project this *perfect, has-it-all-together* Christian persona. Meanwhile Jesus is in the garden sweating blood and crying out in agony asking the Father to take the cup of suffering away from Him. We do a disservice to Jesus and to authentic Christian community when we present a neat, tidy, tuck-in-your-t-shirt Jesus to people that are in dire distress (like Christ) and need to have space to bring their mess to God.

Jesus was still willing to embrace His calling but He didn't walk glibly into it. He arrived with great distress, agony, and messiness at His willfully submission to the Father.

So we should follow in our Leader's footsteps. God wants us as we are, in all our mess, in all our sin, with all of our flaws and failings. Let's stop trying to have it all together and let's go to Jesus in our mess. Let's invite our friends in with us.

One thing I never realized until this very moment is that Jesus was inviting His friends in to His darkest moment as He wrestled with the Father. Peter, James, and John fell asleep, but it doesn't change the fact that Jesus models for us that we are to invite others into our mess and have them sit with us. We were created for this kind of community.

We really need to repent of "having it all together" because we don't. And we need to repent of trying to go through our darkest moments alone, as if it were some noble or spiritual calling to bear our crosses in silence and solitude. We are called to bring our sin, struggles, and lives into the light, and to the embrace of a loving Father and the Christian community He has placed us in.

May we all see more of Jesus as we "get real" with God and as we invite others to the party.

In Jesus' beautiful name, amen!
