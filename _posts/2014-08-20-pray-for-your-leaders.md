> First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.

What the Church needs is more people praying for their leaders. It is all too easy to offer commentary, perspective, criticism, or words. It is another to get on our knees and pray. Would you join me today in praying for [our church](http://marshill.com/) as our leaders gather to seek vision for Mars Hill moving forward? Would you join me in praying for THE Church globally, that God's people would be unified around the Gospel and seeing lost people saved? Would you join me in praying for all of our pastors and leaders, that they would be filled with the Holy Spirit and empowered to do the work of the ministry they are called to by God?

*Jesus, I pray for Pastor Mark, Mars Hill Church, and all of our pastors, deacons, members, and leaders. I pray for the health of our church, that people would connect to Jesus in Community Groups this week, and that people would bring their friends this weekend to hear about Jesus and to fall more in love with Him. I pray for humility, repentance, and grace where it is needed and I ask that You would move in the hearts of the leaders of our church to do what You have called and empowered them to do.*

*Lord, I pray for Your Church in all places, that You would work mightily among your people. I pray that more people would meet Jesus and that more hearts would be opened, and lives changed as You move through Your Holy Spirit. Keep Your bride healthy, God. Keep Your people's hearts tender toward Your truth, Your Word, and toward You. God, we desperately need You to be the center of our lives.*

*Jesus, I finally ask that You would work in all of the pastors and leaders across every local church around the world. Keep them humble, dependent on You, and willing to do whatever they are asked to do to faithfully serve You and to see people meet Jesus. Protect their hearts, their marriages, their families, and their congregations. I pray against Satan and his demons and their works and influence, that You would bring his devices to nothing and that You would advance Your Kingdom and Your Church in the face of all the evil that seems to be prevailing. Build Your Church, Lord and keep us faithful to You. Keep us ready to do Your will and to follow Your Lead.*

*In Jesus' beautiful name I pray. Amen.*
