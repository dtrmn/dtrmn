title: A Holy Doubt
---

> Eventually my fifth-grade dream, along with many others, evaporated completely, and today I am a preacher. I have a family. I live in LA. I am a Christian. I teach the Bible at a church we started in 2006. Nothing could be more different from what I pictured for myself earlier on in life. And the truth is, I couldn’t be more satisfied and more at peace. And that is because God taught me to doubt.

Tim Chaddick's experience forced him to doubt himself and his expectations. This exploration led Him to discover Jesus and the fulfilling life that He has to offer. As Christians we shy away from doubt of any kind, when in actuality we should be given to this "*holy doubt*" as away to see how our false expectations and false hopes don't line up with the life that God has intended for us.

Chaddick continues with this challenging question:

> Are you willing to have your script reworked?

This simple question sets the trajectory for our entire lives and leaves us with a pressing challenge: are we going to accept and embrace the script that God has written for us? Are we willing to follow Jesus, whatever the cost?
