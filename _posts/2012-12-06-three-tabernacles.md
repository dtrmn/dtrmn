title: Three Tabernacles
---

The Scriptures present to us a beautiful and unified theme of God desiring to meet and dwell with mankind. It is woven all through the Old and New Testaments. Pastor Britt Merrick described it eloquently in a sermon as “God’s ancient desire to meet with His people.” Thematically there are numerous ways one could approach studying God’s desire to dwell among His people. Ultimately one should go all the way back to the Garden, where God placed man in the perfect habitation to enjoy fellowship and intimacy with Him.

But a helpful theme emerges in Exodus as God gives the Law and instructs his people in the creation of a tabernacle. In Exodus 25:8 God declares: “And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst.” We see from the foundation of the Law that God’s desire was not distant religion but a personal relationship with His people as He would dwell among them. The Law was designed to lead us into greater intimacy and fellowship with God and align us with how He designed life to work.

In John 1:14 we see this thread continued as John announces to the world that God, the Word, “became flesh” and dwelt (lit. “tabernacled” or “pitched his tent”) among us. God incarnate in the person of Jesus Christ, came to dwell among His people and bring light to the entire world, taking on sin and death to create a way of salvation for us and to bring us into an eternal relationship with Him (John 17:3).

The picture closes as Revelation 21:1-5 looks to the consummation of God’s prophetic movement to dwell with His people. As we are carried in this Church age by the power of His indwelling Spirit, the fulfillment is toward an eternal dwelling with God where it is said, again by John: “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.”

In this completed picture we see God’s heart from all eternity: to dwell with His people. As Christmas quickly approaches this year, may we keep this truth close and meditate on it: that God desires greatly to dwell among us. He gave everything to be with us and bring us into His family; into an eternal and abiding relationship. Into His _shalom_. Let us respond with joyful submission to Him.
