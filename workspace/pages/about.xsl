          <h3>What is the Gospel?</h3>
          <p>This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p>The reality that we are sinfully wicked, have fallen short of God’s glory (Romans 1:27) and are deserving of eternal death. The Bible teaches that we were born into sin and we have also chosen to willfully rebel against God and His rule of our life.</p>
          <p>The more brilliant reality is that God clothed Himself in human flesh in the Person of Jesus Christ and absorbed the wrath of God, atoning for and removing our sin when we trust Him for salvation and repent from our sin.</p>
          <p>This is indeed Good News.</p>
          <p>If you have found your way here, consider with all seriousness the incredible work that Jesus has done on your behalf in becoming sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21).</p>
          <p>Put your trust and faith in Christ and participate in God’s wondrous story of reconciling rebels to Himself—inviting them into His eternal life.</p>
          <p>If you have questions, don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>
          <p>In Christ,</p>
          <p>
