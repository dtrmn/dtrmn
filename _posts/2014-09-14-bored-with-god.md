title: Bored with God
---

I am amazed with what the new iPhone 6 can do. NFC payments. 240fps video at 720p. Bigger, thinner, faster. Technology amazes me. I use it during the weekdays to pound out my [creative work](http://simko.io/). It still amazes me that I can collaborate with people halfway across the globe, send code to remote servers, and somehow magically it all works (well, most of the time...).

The problem is, I am easily impressed by new technology. I am not as easily impressed by God anymore. I don't *fear* and *tremble* at Him like I used to. I don't stand in awe that He made me. That He made us and placed us on this amazing planet. There are 5 living beings in my house right now (2 in their beds, 1 asleep on the couch with another life in her tummy, and me). 2 of us (my wife and I) have been given new life by God. There are 7 expressions of God's life right before my eyes every day, and yet I am distracted by the things of this world, by the fact that I can have thousands and thousands of books on a tablet that I carry around with me. In many ways I am surrounded by what many people around the world dream of having but it is not enough. It is never enough. Now I'm beginning to sound like a [Dustin Kensrue song](https://soundcloud.com/becrecordings/its-not-enough). But it's true. It is so painfully true.

Instead of marveling at the Giver of life, I sit looking at a screen and am amazed over and over until disillusionment sets in. I pretend that the amazement that I find in created things can actually do something to make me whole and satisfy the deep cravings of my soul.

Kensrue penned these striking words:

> It's not enough, it's not enough  
> To make me whole  
> It's not enough, it never was  
> Awake my soul

We need our soul awakened by the Holy Spirit to see God for who He really is, and seeing Him, to **marvel**. To find ourselves lost in His greatness and beauty. He is the only thing that will ever satisfy us. Period.

I'm praying, Church, that we can increasingly be a people that are shaped by this beautiful reality. And may it permeate every square inch of our lives.

In Jesus' beautiful name. Amen.
